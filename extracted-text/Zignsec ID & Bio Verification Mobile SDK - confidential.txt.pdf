ZignSec Mobile-SDK API Documentation 
Overview 
This document provides technical details for integrating with the ZignSec ID & Bio verification 
(Scanning) Mobile-SDK, which utilizes Face SDK and Document Reader SDK for identity document 
verification and biometric verification. 
Usage 
General approach: the mobile device is used for data collection, while backend services handle 
analysis. We recommend “zero-trust” approach.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | Document analysis ===
Document analysis 
Document Analysis is designed for identity verification services that specialize in capturing, reading, 
and digitally verifying passports, ID cards, driver’s licenses, visas, and other identity documents. The 
solution automatically detects the document type against a database of supported IDs before 
securely transmitting the captured document to the backend for analysis.

We offer global ID coverage with full data page processing, including MRZ (Machine Readable Zone), 
Visual Inspection Zones, and Barcode verification. This accelerates customer onboarding by 
providing seamless and secure ID verification, supporting over 14,000 identity documents from 250 
countries and territories.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | For a complete list of supported documents, please look into our supplier’s docu… ===
For a complete list of supported documents, please look into our supplier’s documentation 
https://docs.regulaforensics.com/#useful-resources (at the moment of writing it’s 
https://downloads.regulaforensics.com/work/SDK/doc/AllDocs/Documents List.xls). Please note 
that due to our release cycle, it may take up to 1 month for the document to be fully supported by 
our services (we use only stable releases, and we run a set of time-consuming tests before each 
update testing APIs and UIs, so we update DocReader monthly)


=== Page 5 | paragraph | Document processing scenario ===
Document processing scenario 
Full Processing (FullProcess): A processing scenario designed to extract all available document data, 
including text fields from the visual zone, MRZ, and barcodes. This mode focuses on maximizing data 
extraction accuracy and achieving a high conversion rate and performs only basic security checks.

Authentication (FullAuth): A processing scenario that extracts all available document data and also 
includes document authentication checks. This mode verifies security features such as holograms 
and other embedded document security elements, ensuring the authenticity of the document in 
addition to data extraction.

Liveness Detection: Ensures the face is real and live, preventing spoofing attacks using AI 
and biometric analysis.

can be fooled by a photo).

Document Analysis and Biometry Flows 
Document analysis is a crucial process for identity authentication, ensuring accuracy and security in 
digital transactions. The following flows outline different approaches to verifying a document, 
incorporating various security measures such as biometric liveness detection, RFID processing, and 
retry mechanisms.


=== Page 6 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Simple Flow – A basic verification process that captures a document, analyzes it, and makes 
a final decision.


=== Page 6 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Flow with RFID Check – Enhances verification by incorporating RFID chip processing for 
documents that support it.


=== Page 6 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Flow with Retry – Introduces a retry mechanism, allowing users to attempt verification 
again if the initial process fails.


=== Page 6 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Document + Biometry Analysis – Combines liveness detection with document verification, 
ensuring the person is real before validating their document.

1. Start Document Verification – The process is 
initiated by the user or system. 
2. Capture Document Using Phone Camera – The user 
takes a picture of the document using their phone 
camera. Mobile SDK guides the user through the process 
3. Finalize package – The captured document and all 
the related data are encrypted and transmitted to the 
server, transactionId is returned. 
4. Send transaction id to backend – the further 
decision to be done on backend, nothing to be 
transferred from the device but the transactionId from 
the previous step 
5. Backend Reprocessing – Mobile application 
backend initiates “reprocessing” sending transaction id 
to the backend.  
6. Decision: Accept? - Mobile application backend 
analyzes processing response and makes the final 
decision to authorize user or not.

Authentication 
OAuth2 Authentication 
ZignSec Mobile-SDK uses OAuth2 for secure authentication. Clients must obtain an access token 
before making API requests using the token endpoint (the endpoint address to be taken from the 
proper OpenID configuration)

obtain access credentials.

Authentication headers 
2 headers are required to authenticate calls – Authorization header should contain Bearer jwt 
token (received from oauth token endpoint), and Zs-Product-Key header should contain product

It's recommended to implement a retry policy and retry if 401 or 403 status code returned with a 
different key. This way we'll be able to rotate keys zero-downtime.

Please also keep in mind that access token is a short-lived token, its lifetime is 20 minutes by default

reader-sdk/mobile/integration/integration-with-face-sdk/#integration-with-face-sdk) only describes 
livePortrait as a base64 string, but it’s highly recommended to send the liveness transaction id there 
instead of the image itself to properly follow the zero-trust to mobile concept.

Analyze results 
When all processing is done you need to analyze responses and make a final decision authorize the 
user or not. It can be simple mapping from the response or can involve complex logic (for instance 
for some document types errors in fields could be ignored, or you can validate the number of 
scanned pages/sides depending on the document type and implement retry)
