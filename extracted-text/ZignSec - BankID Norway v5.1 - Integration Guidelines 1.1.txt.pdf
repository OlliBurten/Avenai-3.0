across platforms. The logo should meet specific size and format requirements (300 x 60 px, max

Handling Errors 
If an error occurs during an ongoing authentication or signing session, the following scenarios may 
take place:


=== Page 7 | paragraph | • ===
• 
The end-user might be shown an error message, often accompanied by an error code, with 
options to retry or return to the merchant application.


=== Page 7 | paragraph | • ===
• 
If the error occurs under the "right conditions," the user can be redirected back to the 
merchant application, using the same parameters as when a user cancels the session.


=== Page 7 | paragraph | • ===
• 
In rare cases, an error other than access_denied might be returned, along with an 
error_description parameter, depending on the situation.


=== Page 7 | paragraph | • ===
• 
In severe cases, the user might be stuck on the BankID platform with no option to return to 
the merchant application.
