=== Page 4 | paragraph | BankID ===
BankID 
BankID is a trusted electronic identification system in Sweden, built on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It 
provides secure authentication and non-repudiation for online transactions. The system employs two-factor 
authentication (2FA), combining a personal certificate tied to an individual's social security number with a 
PIN or password. End-to-end encryption ensures data security. As of September 2021, it was a fundamental 
part of Sweden's digital infrastructure with over 8 million active users, regulated by the Swedish Financial 
Supervisory Authority.

Ways of integration BankID 
ZignSec provides two ways for implementing Swedish BankID:


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Browser Flow- The workflow is executed within a ZignSec-controlled browser session.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
API Flow - A backend without a user interface, suitable for server, mobile, desktop app, or custom 
scenarios. This flow also includes the Phone Flow - An authentication process when the user is 
engaged in a telephone conversation.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | The use cases are: ===
Use cases 
Swedish BankID can be implemented in different ways, depending on the device initiating the flow. 
The use cases are:


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
The user aims to authenticate using an app on the same device where the BankID app is installed.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
The user aims to authenticate using a web browser running on other device than the one the BankID 
app is installed on. For this use case, QR code is the recommended way to trigger authentication.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Please find more details in the references


=== Page 5 | paragraph | Here are examples of the links showing the visual flow. ===
Here are examples of the links showing the visual flow.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Mobile device - same device flow where the app is installed and triggered from the mobile.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Desktop to mobile device - other device flow where the app is triggered on the desktop to the 
mobile by QR-code.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | • ===
• 
Desktop same device - same device flow when the app is installed on the desktop and triggered 
there. This flow is the least common since most users have the BankID installed on their mobile.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | Note! More than 80% of BankID users are only using the BankID mobile app. ===
Note! More than 80% of BankID users are only using the BankID mobile app.


=== Page 5 | paragraph | Authentication or Sign ===
Authentication or Sign 
Authentication is aimed for identification and sign to be used for digital signatures. But both methods except 
the same parameters this is a change from previous versions when there was limitations to adding text in 
the BankID app.

Browser Flow 
Execution Sequence 
The initial call triggers the end user's operation - either authenticate or sign. This call instantly activates the 
authenticate or sign process, and the BankID app is immediately notified to display either authenticate or 
sign. To avoid continuous polling, consider configuring a webhook for “completed/error”. Execution

3. Retrieving Status/Results: Get status and individual data using the unique workflow sessionID code. 
Make this call during or after the workflow is completed. The workflow can indicate pending, 
completed, or error status (exception, user cancel, timeout) via a browser redirect to the redirect 
success (or failure) URL and/or through a webhook. (Link to Sample Result response)

1. This initial call triggers the authenticate or sign process on the BankID backend instantly, alerting the 
BankID app to display the authenticate or sign page. It's advisable to have a web hook set up for 
“completion/error” to bypass frequent checks. 
Establish a login session and launch BankID backend and app for the designated operation - 
Authenticate or Sign. This will result in a new BankID session token. (Link to Sample request)
