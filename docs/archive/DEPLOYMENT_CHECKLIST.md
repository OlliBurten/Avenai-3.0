## 📊 POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION

### **Step 1: Health Checks** (2 min)
```bash
# Production health
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected: {"status":"ok",...}
```

### **Step 2: Smoke Test** (5 min)
Run 2 quick queries in production UI:
1. "Give me three terminated reason IDs" → Should return 27, 131, 133
2. "Explain the async polling cadence" → Should mention 5 minutes, 60-90 seconds

### **Step 3: Monitor Logs** (10 min)
Watch for:
```
✅ pgvector returned X hits
🎯 Intent detected: [TYPE]
📊 Confidence: HIGH
```

If you see database fallback or errors, rollback immediately.

---

## 🎯 ROLLBACK PLAN

If anything goes wrong:

```bash
# Vercel rollback (instant)
vercel rollback

# Or via dashboard:
# Vercel > Deployments > Select previous > Promote
```

**Safe Previous Build**: Your last stable deployment (if any)

## 📈 MONITORING SETUP

### **What to Watch (First 24 Hours)**

1. **Error Rate**
   - Target: <5%
   - Alert if >10%

2. **Response Time**
   - Target: <10s average
   - Alert if >15s p95
