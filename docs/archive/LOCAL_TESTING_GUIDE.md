## üöÄ **How To Test Locally**

### **Step 1: Start Dev Server**

The dev server doesn't have the build error - it works perfectly!

```bash
cd "/Users/harburt/Desktop/Avenai 3.0"
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úì Ready in 2.5s
‚ö¨ Local:        http://localhost:3000
‚úì Starting...
‚úì Compiled / in 1.2s
```

### **Step 2: Access Your App**

Open: **http://localhost:3000**

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Upload a Document** üìÑ

1. Go to a dataset page
2. Click "Upload Documents"
3. Upload a PDF, TXT, or MD file
4. Watch the console logs for:
   ```
   üìÑ DocumentProcessor: Starting pgvector embedding process
   üìÑ DocumentProcessor: Generating embeddings
   üìÑ DocumentProcessor: pgvector storage completed
   ```

**Expected**: Document should process and embeddings stored in pgvector ‚úÖ

---

### **Test 2: Ask a Question** üí¨

1. Open the Copilot panel
2. Ask: "What is this document about?"
3. Watch console for:
   ```
   üìä pgvector hybrid (semantic + keyword) matches: X
   üí¨ Chat session: session_xxx
   üìö Conversation history loaded: messageCount: 0
   ```

**Expected**: Get an answer based on pgvector search ‚úÖ

---

### **Test 3: Follow-Up Question** üîÑ (NEW!)

After Test 2, ask a follow-up:
1. Ask: "Tell me more" or "What about errors?"
2. Watch console for:
   ```
   üìö Conversation history loaded: messageCount: 2
   üí¨ Added conversation history to OpenAI call
   üíæ Conversation saved
   ```

**Expected**: Bot understands context from previous question ‚úÖ

---

### **Test 4: Repeated Query** ‚ö° (Caching)

1. Ask the same question twice
2. First time: ~150-200ms
3. Second time: Watch for:
   ```
   üíæ Cache HIT for query: "..."
   ```
4. Second time: ~25-50ms ‚Üê Much faster!

**Expected**: Cached queries are 3-6x faster ‚úÖ

---

### **Test 5: Multi-Turn Conversation** üí¨

Try this conversation flow:
```
You: "How do I authenticate?"
Bot: [Gives auth answer]

You: "What about OAuth?"
Bot: [Understands you're still talking about authentication]

You: "Show me an example"
Bot: [Provides example for the authentication topic]
```

**Expected**: Natural conversation with context awareness ‚úÖ

---

## üìä **What To Look For In Logs**

### **Good Signs** ‚úÖ

```bash
# pgvector is working:
üìä pgvector hybrid (semantic + keyword) matches: 8

# Conversation memory is working:
üí¨ Chat session: session_1234...
üìö Conversation history loaded: messageCount: 4
üíæ Conversation saved

# Caching is working:
üíæ Cache HIT for query: "how do I authenticate..."
```

### **Problems** ‚ùå

```bash
# If you see:
‚ö†Ô∏è pgvector search failed

# Check:
1. Database migration ran successfully in Neon
2. Embeddings column exists
3. Database connection is working
```

---

## üîç **Console Commands To Verify**

### **Check Embedding Coverage:**
```typescript
// In browser console or node REPL:
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/debug/embeddings-status')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

### **Check Cache Stats:**
```typescript
// After a few queries, check cache performance
// (Will add an API endpoint for this)
```

### **Check Conversation Stats:**
```typescript
// See conversation analytics
// (Will add an API endpoint for this)
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

| Test | Expected Result | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Upload document** | Embeddings stored in pgvector | [ ] |
| **Ask question** | pgvector search returns results | [ ] |
| **Follow-up question** | Context from previous message | [ ] |
| **Repeated query** | Cache hit, faster response | [ ] |
| **Multi-turn dialogue** | Natural conversation flow | [ ] |

---

## üìù **Test Checklist**

### **Document Processing:**
- [ ] Upload PDF - processes successfully
- [ ] Upload TXT - processes successfully
- [ ] Upload MD - processes successfully
- [ ] Check logs for "pgvector storage completed"
- [ ] Verify no Pinecone-related errors

### **Search Quality:**
- [ ] Semantic search works
- [ ] Keyword search works
- [ ] Hybrid search combines both
- [ ] Results are relevant
- [ ] No "no results" errors

### **Conversation Memory:**
- [ ] First question creates session
- [ ] Second question loads history
- [ ] Follow-up questions work
- [ ] Context maintained across messages
- [ ] Pronouns resolved correctly

### **Performance:**
- [ ] First query < 200ms
- [ ] Cached query < 50ms
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] No database connection issues

## üö® **If Something Doesn't Work**

### **Problem: No Search Results**
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you uploaded documents AFTER running the Neon migration
- Old documents won't have embeddings yet
- Re-upload a test document

### **Problem: Conversation Memory Not Working**
**Solution**:
- Check console for "üìö Conversation history loaded"
- Verify ChatSession and ChatMessage tables exist
- Check database connection

### **Problem: Slow Queries**
**Solution**:
- Check if embeddings are being stored
- Verify indexes were created in Neon
- Run: `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'document_chunks'`

### **Problem: Cache Not Working**
**Solution**:
- Normal - in-memory cache starts empty
- After 2nd identical query, should see cache hits
- Check console for "üíæ Cache HIT" messages

---

## üéÅ **New Features To Try**

### **1. Multi-Turn Conversations**
```
You: "How do I auth?"
Bot: "Use Bearer token..."

You: "What if it fails?" ‚Üê Context-aware!
Bot: "For authentication failures..."
```

### **2. Pronoun Resolution**
```
You: "Tell me about the API"
Bot: "The API provides..."

You: "How do I use it?" ‚Üê Knows "it" = API
Bot: "To use the API, you need..."
```

### **3. Intelligent Caching**
```
First time:  "How to authenticate?" ‚Üí 150ms
Second time: "How to authenticate?" ‚Üí 25ms ‚ö°
```

---

## üìä **What To Monitor**

### **In Console Logs:**
- `üìä pgvector hybrid` - Search is working
- `üí¨ Chat session` - Sessions being created
- `üìö Conversation history loaded` - History loading
- `üíæ Conversation saved` - Messages being saved
- `üíæ Cache HIT` - Caching working

### **Performance Metrics:**
- Search latency should be < 200ms
- Cached queries should be < 50ms
- No database errors
- No Pinecone errors
