# Activity & Uploads Tab Implementation

## Overview
The Activity & Uploads tab in the copilot/dataset workspace page has been fully implemented with real data from the database, replacing the placeholder/mock data.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **New API Endpoints**

#### `/api/documents/activity` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Fetches real-time activity events for a dataset
- **Authentication**: Requires valid session
- **Authorization**: Verifies user has access to the dataset through organization membership
- **Returns**: Array of activity events based on document status changes
- **Features**:
  - Fetches last 50 documents ordered by update time
  - Transforms document statuses into activity event types (uploaded, processing, indexed, failed, ready)
  - Includes metadata like coverage percentage and chunk counts
  - Shows error messages for failed documents

#### `/api/documents/stats` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Provides statistical overview of uploads for a dataset
- **Authentication**: Requires valid session
- **Authorization**: Verifies user has access to the dataset
- **Returns**: Comprehensive upload statistics including:
  - Total documents count
  - Completed documents count
  - Documents currently processing
  - Failed documents count
  - Total storage used
  - Total chunks indexed
  - Average coverage percentage

### 2. **Enhanced Components**

#### `ActivityFeed.tsx` (`/components/workspace/docs/`)
**Changes Made:**
- âœ… Removed hardcoded mock data fallback
- âœ… Now fetches real data from `/api/documents/activity` API
- âœ… Added real-time polling (refreshes every 12 seconds)
- âœ… Added visual refresh indicator with pulsing blue dot
- âœ… Groups events by "Today" and "Earlier"
- âœ… Shows rich event information:
  - Document upload events
  - Processing status updates
  - Indexing completion
  - Ready-for-chat notifications
  - Failed document alerts with error details
- âœ… Displays coverage percentages and chunk counts
- âœ… Time-ago formatting (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago")
- âœ… Color-coded event types with appropriate icons

#### `UploadStats.tsx` (NEW)
**Features:**
- ðŸ“Š Visual statistics dashboard with 6 key metrics:
  1. **Total Uploads** - Total number of documents
  2. **Completed** - Successfully processed documents
  3. **Processing** - Currently processing documents
  4. **Failed** - Documents that failed processing
  5. **Total Size** - Storage used (formatted as B/KB/MB/GB)
  6. **Avg Coverage** - Average coverage across completed docs
- ðŸŽ¨ Color-coded cards with icons
- âš¡ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ðŸ”„ Manual refresh button
- ðŸ“ˆ Special highlight banner showing total chunks indexed
- ðŸ“± Responsive grid layout

#### `WorkspaceShell.tsx`
**Changes Made:**
- âœ… Imported new `UploadStats` component
- âœ… Enhanced "Activity & Uploads" section to show both:
  - Upload Statistics (at top)
  - Recent Activity Feed (below)
- âœ… Better visual hierarchy with section dividers
- âœ… Updated both widget-enabled and fallback layouts

### 3. **Database Integration**

The implementation properly uses the Prisma schema:
- âœ… `Document` model fields: `status`, `indexedChunks`, `coverage`, `errorMessage`, `fileSize`
- âœ… `DocumentStatus` enum: `UPLOADING`, `PROCESSING`, `INDEXING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`
- âœ… Proper organization-level access control
- âœ… Dataset ownership verification

## Features

### Real-Time Updates
- **Activity Feed**: Automatically polls for new events every 12 seconds
- **Upload Stats**: Refreshes statistics every 30 seconds
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows "Refreshing activity..." with pulsing dot during updates

### Security
- âœ… Session-based authentication
- âœ… Organization-level authorization
- âœ… Dataset ownership verification
- âœ… No data leakage between organizations

### User Experience
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful, color-coded UI with icons
- ðŸ“Š Clear visual hierarchy
- âš¡ Fast loading with skeleton states
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive design
- ðŸ”„ Auto-refresh with manual option
- ðŸ“ˆ Comprehensive metrics at a glance

### Event Types Tracked
1. **Uploaded** (ðŸ”µ Blue) - Document just uploaded
2. **Processing** (ðŸŸ¡ Yellow) - Document being processed
3. **Indexed** (ðŸŸ£ Purple) - Chunks created and indexed
4. **Ready** (ðŸŸ¢ Green) - Document ready for chat
5. **Failed** (ðŸ”´ Red) - Processing failed with error message

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to any dataset workspace page
2. Scroll to "Activity & Uploads" section
3. Click to expand
4. View:
   - **Upload Statistics** dashboard at the top
   - **Recent Activity** feed below showing real-time events
5. Data auto-refreshes in background

### For Developers
```typescript
// Activity Feed Component
<ActivityFeed datasetId={dataset.id} />

// Upload Stats Component
<UploadStats datasetId={dataset.id} />
```

## API Response Examples

### Activity Events Response
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "doc_123",
      "type": "ready",
      "fileName": "API Documentation.pdf",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-13T10:30:00.000Z",
      "coverage": 95,
      "chunks": 42
    },
    {
      "id": "doc_124",
      "type": "failed",
      "fileName": "corrupted.pdf",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-13T10:25:00.000Z",
      "details": "Failed to extract text from PDF"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Stats Response
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "total": 25,
    "completed": 22,
    "processing": 2,
    "failed": 1,
    "totalSize": 15728640,
    "totalChunks": 1234,
    "avgCoverage": 92
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- âœ… No linter errors
- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… API endpoints properly secured
- âœ… Database queries optimized
- âœ… Real-time polling working
- âœ… Error handling implemented
- âœ… Empty states handled gracefully
- âœ… Loading states with skeletons
- âœ… Responsive design maintained

## Performance Considerations

1. **Polling Intervals**:
   - Activity: 12 seconds (frequent for real-time feel)
   - Stats: 30 seconds (less frequent for aggregated data)

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Limited to last 50 documents for activity
   - Only fetches required fields with `select`
   - Indexed queries on `datasetId` and `status`

3. **Caching Potential**:
   - Consider adding Redis cache for high-traffic datasets
   - Can implement SWR (stale-while-revalidate) strategy

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- [ ] WebSocket/SSE for instant updates instead of polling
- [ ] Pagination for activity feed (currently shows all 50)
- [ ] Export activity logs to CSV
- [ ] Filter activity by event type
- [ ] Date range selector for historical activity
- [ ] More detailed analytics charts
- [ ] Activity notifications/alerts
- [ ] Per-document activity drill-down

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `/app/api/documents/activity/route.ts` (NEW)
2. âœ… `/app/api/documents/stats/route.ts` (NEW)
3. âœ… `/components/workspace/docs/ActivityFeed.tsx` (ENHANCED)
4. âœ… `/components/workspace/docs/UploadStats.tsx` (NEW)
5. âœ… `/components/workspace/WorkspaceShell.tsx` (UPDATED)

## Migration Notes

- âœ… No database migrations required (uses existing schema)
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing APIs
- âœ… Backward compatible (gracefully handles missing data)
- âœ… Feature flag compatible (`UNIFIED_WORKSPACE=true`)
