## ✅ TEST 2: "What are BankID Sweden security considerations?"

### RAG Answer:
> Got it — you're asking about the security considerations for BankID Sweden.
> BankID is a secure electronic identification system in Sweden that relies on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the authenticity and integrity of online transactions. It employs two-factor authentication (2FA), which combines a personal certificate linked to an individual's social security number with a PIN or password. This method provides a robust layer of security by ensuring that both something the user knows (the PIN/password) and something the user has (the personal certificate) are required for authentication.
> Moreover, BankID uses end-to-end encryption to protect data during transmission, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access. This system is a critical component of Sweden's digital infrastructure, with oversight by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to maintain high security and regulatory standards [doc:#1, p. 59].
> If you need more details on implementation, the BankID Sweden V5 Implementation Guidelines could be a useful resource. Want a quick overview of those guidelines?

BankID is a trusted electronic identification system in Sweden, built on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It 
provides secure authentication and non-repudiation for online transactions. The system employs two-factor 
authentication (2FA), combining a personal certificate tied to an individual's social security number with a 
PIN or password. End-to-end encryption ensures data security. As of September 2021, it was a fundamental 
part of Sweden's digital infrastructure with over 8 million active users, regulated by the Swedish Financial 
Supervisory Authority.
