# ✅ Clickable Source Citations Feature

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Author:** Cursor AI

---

## 🎯 Problem

User reported that source citations in the copilot chat were **not clickable** to view the original PDF text. The UI showed source chips but users couldn't verify the AI's answers against the actual document content.

### What Was Missing:
1. ❌ Source chips were hover-only (showed snippet on hover)
2. ❌ No way to click and see full document context
3. ❌ No API to fetch the complete chunk text
4. ❌ No modal/dialog to display the source content

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Created `SourceModal` Component**
**File:** `components/copilot/SourceModal.tsx`

A full-featured modal that:
- ✅ Displays document title, page number, and section path
- ✅ Fetches and shows the **full chunk context** (not just snippet)
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Error handling with fallback to cached snippet
- ✅ Beautiful UI with backdrop blur and animations
- ✅ Click outside or X button to close

### **2. Created Chunk API Endpoint**
**File:** `app/api/chunks/[chunkId]/route.ts`

Secure API that:
- ✅ Authenticates users via NextAuth
- ✅ Checks dataset access permissions
- ✅ Fetches full chunk content from database
- ✅ Returns document metadata (title, pages, section path)
- ✅ Extracts page number from chunk metadata

### **3. Updated `SourceChips` Component**
**File:** `components/copilot/SourceChips.tsx`

Enhanced to:
- ✅ Changed from `<span>` to `<button>` for proper clickability
- ✅ Added `onClick` handler to open modal
- ✅ Accepts `datasetId` prop for API calls
- ✅ Hover state changes to blue to indicate clickability
- ✅ Keeps existing hover tooltip for quick preview
- ✅ Shows modal when source is clicked

### **4. Updated `SharedChatState` Component**
**File:** `components/workspace/SharedChatState.tsx`

- ✅ Passes `datasetId` prop to `<SourceChips>` component

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before:
```
[Source chip] ← hover only, shows snippet
```

### After:
```
[Source chip] ← hover shows snippet
      ↓ click
   [Modal with full context]
   - Document title
   - Page number
   - Section path
   - Full paragraph/chunk text
   - [Close button]
```

---

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ **Authentication required**: Uses NextAuth session
- ✅ **Authorization check**: Validates user has access to dataset
- ✅ **Organization-scoped**: Only returns chunks from user's organization
- ✅ **No direct chunk access**: Must provide valid datasetId

---

## 📊 API Endpoint

### `GET /api/chunks/[chunkId]?datasetId={datasetId}`

**Request:**
```bash
GET /api/chunks/cm123abc?datasetId=cmh1c687x0001d8hiq6wop6a1
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "cm123abc",
  "content": "BankID is a trusted electronic identification system...",
  "chunkIndex": 5,
  "sectionPath": "BankID > Security Considerations",
  "page": 4,
  "document": {
    "id": "doc123",
    "title": "ZignSec BankID Sweden V5 Implementation Guidelines",
    "pages": 38
  }
}
```

**Error Cases:**
- `401 Unauthorized` - No valid session
- `400 Bad Request` - Missing datasetId
- `404 Not Found` - Chunk doesn't exist or access denied
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Database/server error

## 🧪 Testing

To test this feature:

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to a dataset with documents**

3. **Ask a question that triggers RAG retrieval:**
   ```
   "What are BankID Sweden security considerations?"
   ```

4. **Look for source chips at the bottom of the AI response:**
   ```
   📄 ZignSec BankID Sweden • p.4 • Security Considerations
   ```

5. **Hover over a chip:**
   - Should show blue hover state
   - Tooltip appears with snippet

6. **Click on a chip:**
   - Modal should open with full context
   - Should show document title, page, section
   - Should load full chunk text
   - Can close with X button or click outside
