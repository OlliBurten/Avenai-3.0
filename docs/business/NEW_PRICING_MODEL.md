## 🎯 **Why This Model Works**

### ✅ **Psychology & Economics**
1. **FREE tier is strict** → Forces upgrades fast but still useful for dev testing
2. **PRO is priced perfectly** → $99/month is SaaS sweet spot
3. **ENTERPRISE adds real value** → Compliance, integrations, white-labeling
4. **Add-ons provide upsell levers** → Even Pro users can be monetized further
5. **Predictable costs** → Fixed pricing with optional usage-based overages

### ✅ **Market Positioning**
- **FREE** → "Test Drive Avenai"
- **PRO** → "For Growing SaaS Companies" 
- **ENTERPRISE** → "For Enterprises Who Need Control"

### ✅ **Revenue Optimization**
- **Higher conversion** from FREE to PRO (strict limits)

## 💡 **Key Insights**

1. **Document limits were too high** - 100 docs on FREE meant users never upgraded
2. **Enterprise was just "more of the same"** - Now it's feature-driven
3. **Storage limits were irrelevant** - PDFs/markdown are tiny files
4. **No upsell pressure** - New model forces upgrades quickly
5. **Missing add-on revenue** - New model includes multiple revenue streams

This pricing model aligns with real-world SaaS buyer psychology and maximizes both adoption and revenue potential.
